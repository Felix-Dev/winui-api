## -description

The Tab control is a collection of tabs that each represents a new page or document in your app. Tab controls are useful when your app has several pages of content and the user expects to be able to add, close, and rearrange the pages.

**Is this the right control?**

Use a TabControl to help the user manage multiple app pages or documents within the same window.
Do not use a TabControl to display a static set of tabs that the user cannot rearrange, open, or close. Use a Pivot or top NavigationView instead.
