# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Layout

<!--
public class Layout : Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyObject
-->

## -description

Represents the base class for an object that sizes and arranges child elements for a host.

## -remarks

You should not use or inherit from the Layout class directly. Instead, inherit from its derived classes, [NonVirtualizingLayout](nonvirtualizinglayout.md) or [VirtualizingLayout](virtualizinglayout.md).

Provided concrete layout classes are [FlowLayout](flowlayout.md), [StackLayout](stacklayout.md), and [UniformGridLayout](uniformgridlayout.md).

## -examples

See the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app for examples of WinUI features and controls.

If you have the **XAML Controls Gallery** app installed, [open the app to see the controls in action](xamlcontrolsgallery:).

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 Preview branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for WinUI 3 Preview controls and features).
