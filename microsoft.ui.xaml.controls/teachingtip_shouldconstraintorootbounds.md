## -description

Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the teaching tip will constrain to the bounds of its xaml root.

## -property-value

## -remarks

If no placement option would allow a teaching tip to fully show, teaching tip will iterate through its event lifecycle to force a close rather than display without an accessible close button. If the app cancels the Closing event, the teaching tip may remain open without an accessible Close button.
