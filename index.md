# Windows UI Library namespaces

## -description

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is a native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows Desktop and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications.

There are two versions of WinUI: **WinUI 2.x** and **WinUI 3** (see the [Windows UI Library overview](/windows/apps/winui/) for more details).

The namespaces and APIs documented here are valid for both versions.

## -remarks

Both WinUI 2.x and WinUI 3 ship as NuGet packages.

### WinUI 2.x

The WinUI 2.x NuGet package is installed through the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager and can be used in standard UWP projects, or in Win32 apps via XAML Islands.

For more details, see [Getting started with the Windows UI 2.x Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui2/getting-started).

### WinUI 3

WinUI 3 Preview 2 can be used in all Desktop apps, but you must download and install the [WinUI 3 Preview 2 VSIX package](https://aka.ms/winui3/previewdownload) to add the WinUI 3 project templates and NuGet package containing the WinUI 3 libraries to Visual Studio 2019.

For instructions and more details, see [Windows UI Library 3 Preview 2 (July 2020)](https://aka.ms/winui-docs).

### Samples

Examples of WinUI features and controls are available in the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app.

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view the XAML Controls Gallery source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery).

> [!NOTE]
> See the [WinUI 3 Preview 2 branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) of the XAML Controls Gallery for a sample app that demonstrates all WinUI 3 Preview 2 controls and features.
